			<p class="mt-4 text-base max-w-xl md:text-lg tracking-wide">I am a self-taught programmer from the Philippines, currently learning Go for backend development and Svelte for frontend development. In addition to these programming languages, I also have an interest in learning Rust, which is known for its performance and safety features. As a self-taught programmer, I am constantly seeking out new learning opportunities and challenges to improve my skills and expand my knowledge in the field of computer programming. I am passionate about using technology to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions.
